[Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) is a Hugo theme for technical documentation sites, providing easy site navigation, structure, and more. This **Docsy Example Project** uses the Docsy theme, as well as providing a skeleton documentation structure for you to use. You can either copy this project and edit it with your own content, or use the theme in your projects like any other [Hugo theme](https://gohugo.io/themes/installing-and-using-themes/).

This Docsy Example Project is hosted at [https://testydocsy.netlify.com/](https://testydocsy.netlify.com/).

You can find detailed theme instructions in the example project site under **Documentation -> Getting Started**.

This is not an officially supported Google product. This project is currently maintained.

## Using the Docsy Example Project as a template

The Docsy Example Project is a template project, so it's easy to create your own copy to edit. To create your own copy of the Docsy example site repo:

1. Go to the [repo page](https://github.com/google/docsy-example) and click **Use this template**.

1. Type your chosen name for your new repository in the **Repository name** field. You can also add an optional **Description**.

1. Click **Create repository from template** to create your new repository. Congratulations, you now have a Docsy site repo!

1. To test your copied site locally with Hugo, or make local edits, you'll also need to make a local copy of your new repository. To do this, use `git clone`, replacing `https://github.com/my/example.git` with your repo's web URL (don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site):

    <pre>
    git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 <em>https://github.com/my/example.git</em>
    </pre>

You can now edit your local versions of the site's source files. To preview your site, go to your site root directory and run `hugo server`. By default, your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. To push changes to your new repo, go to your site root directory and use `git push`.

The Docsy theme is included as a Git submodule so you can update it easily:

```bash
â–¶ git submodule
 a053131a4ebf6a59e4e8834a42368e248d98c01d themes/docsy (heads/master)
```

If you want to do SCSS edits and want to publish these, you need to install `PostCSS` (not needed for `hugo server`):

```bash
npm install
```

<!--### Cloning the Example from the Theme Project


```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/docsy.git
cd tech-doc-hugo-theme/exampleSite
HUGO_THEMESDIR="../.." hugo server
```


Note that the Hugo Theme Site requires the `exampleSite` to live in a subfolder of the theme itself. To avoid recursive duplication, the example site is added as a Git subtree:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix exampleSite https://github.com/google/docsy.git  master --squash
```

To pull in changes, see `pull-deps.sh` script in the theme.-->
